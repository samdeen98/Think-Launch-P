# ten things I learned from installfest:

- ls(for mac) & dir(for pc) - show us what is in the folder
- touch : command to create a file
- 'cd' : change directory we are in
- pwd : figures out where you are
- git status
- git commit -m"this is a comment"
- mkdir : make directory
- md : file type 'mark down'
- git status
- git add .
- . is everything
